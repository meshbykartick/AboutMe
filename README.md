About Me
Hi, I’m Kartick Samanta — a research scholar at the TIFR Centre for Applicable Mathematics.

I have a deep passion for technology, computational mathematics, and simulation. My academic journey began with a B.Sc. in Mathematics, which laid the foundation for my growing interest in applying mathematics to real-world problems through computation and modeling.

At TIFR-CAM, my research focuses on leveraging mathematical theory and computational techniques to explore complex systems, simulate dynamic behavior, and push the boundaries of what applied mathematics can achieve.

When I’m not immersed in code or equations, I enjoy staying updated with the latest in tech and exploring new tools that bridge theory with practical applications.

This space is where I share insights from my work, projects I’m passionate about, and ideas at the intersection of math and technology. Thanks for visiting — and feel free to connect!
